## What does the future look like? 📍

During my studies at Haaga-Helia UAS and through my gained work experience, I have realized that future skills heavily depend on how well one can embrace change. Data analytics has demonstrated that information contains numerous building blocks for understanding our current situation and envisioning what it could become in the future. I have had the opportunity to explore corporate databases and operating systems, observing the immense potential for automating various business processes. Working in environments where financial figures drive a company's success has shown me that data and technology play a great role in future market competitiveness.

My ambition to expand the use of data, learn language models, and deepen my understanding of machine learning will open doors to working with future-oriented companies. I aim to create business processes that offer users innovative ways to work and make decisions.

In my learning journey today, I focus heavily on understanding and interpreting the Python programming language, statistics, and the fundamentals of ICT technology. As a systematic individual, I thrive in environments with structure and consistency. In the future, I aspire to contribute to organizational transformations internally or provide solutions through consulting services.
